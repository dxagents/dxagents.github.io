<p><b>Question 16</b>: A 40-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of increased bilateral pain in his knees. The pain developed over time and now limits his mobility. He states that the pain is worse at the end of the day, though he does have some early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes. He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother’s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient’s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints?</p>

<p><b>Question 18</b>: A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?</p>
