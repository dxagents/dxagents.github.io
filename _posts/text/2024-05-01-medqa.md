His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?</p>

<p><b>Question 41</b>: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain in his right knee for the past week. The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?</p>

(A) Administration of oral ketorolac<br>

(B) Perform joint aspiration<br>

(C) Open reduction of the tuberosity<br>
